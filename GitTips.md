## Recommended Git Tips
* Naming Conventions of a repository on Git must be lowercase.
* Commit messages should be precise and action based.
* Each repository must have README.md file
* Use ### and ## for Headings and Sub-Headings respectively
* Use Bullet, when necessary not everytime! Otherwise plain text with no bullets
